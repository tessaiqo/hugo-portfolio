I'm a passionate software engineer with expertise in building scalable web applications and developer tools. With a focus on clean code, performance optimization, and user experience, I help teams ship products that users love.

## What I Do

I specialize in full-stack development with a keen interest in:

- **Backend Engineering** — Building robust APIs and microservices with modern frameworks
- **Frontend Development** — Creating responsive, accessible user interfaces
- **DevOps & Infrastructure** — Container orchestration, CI/CD, and cloud platforms
- **Open Source** — Contributing to and maintaining open-source projects

## Timeline Demonstration

> This page demonstrates the **standard about layout** with a timeline feature. Use horizontal rules (`---`) to separate timeline entries. Each section becomes a card in the timeline visualization.

### Current Focus

Right now, I'm exploring minimal design patterns, modern web frameworks, and building tools that make developers' lives easier. I believe in writing code that is simple, maintainable, and well-documented.

## How This Layout Works

This about page uses the **timeline layout**. Here's how to customize it:

1. Set `layout = "about"` in the frontmatter
2. Write your introduction before the first `---` separator
3. Each section after `---` becomes a timeline card
4. Use markdown formatting: **bold** for job titles, *italic* for dates
5. Add links using `[text](url)` syntax
6. Timeline items appear in chronological order (newest first)

### Features Demonstrated

- ✅ Hero section with avatar and subtitle
- ✅ Timeline visualization with markers and cards
- ✅ Markdown content with formatting
- ✅ Links and emphasis
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Social links in footer
